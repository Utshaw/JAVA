# Object Oriented Programming
## Four principles of OOP: 
1. Inheritance: relationship of classes, a class can have variables, functions of another class
2. Encapsulation: Hiding data from other classes via access modifier
3. Abstraction: Hiding details from outside the class
4. Polymorphism: Having a Java element which can be used in many forms. Example: functions with the same function name but different parameters
